    <h2>A South German Dream</h2>
    <p>Spätzle are South Germany's answer to Noodles, made from just Eggs, <br>
        Flour and a pinch of Salt, they fit almost every german Dish perfectly. <br>
        They are cheap, easy to make and taste <i>sooo</i> good!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>210g Flour</li>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Water</li>
        <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>A tool called a Spätzle Press is needed <br> to squeeze the Dough into the water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a Pot of water to boil, (don't forget to salt the water).</li>
        <li>In the meantime mix all ingredients thoroughly until they turn into a sticky dough. </li>
        <li>Put some of the dough into the Press (don't fill it up to much).</li>
        <li>When the Water is Boiling press the Dough into the Water.</li>
        <li>When the Water starts to foam take the spätzle out of the water with a sieve and place them in a Bowl.</li>
        <li>Repeat until done and enjoy your Spätzle, either just like that, or as a side dish with a delicious german meal.</li>
